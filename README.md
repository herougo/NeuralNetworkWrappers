## Neural Network Wrappers

This is a respository of a collection of class wrappers for neural networks implemented in Tensorflow/Keras. These will help with rapid prototype development and provide custom error messages. The goal is to have wrappers for all of the listed models when I have the time.

To Do
- [ ] LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Predicting Characters in Text
- [ ] Word2Vec and/or Glove
- [ ] Generative Adversarial Network for Image Generation
- [ ] Convolutional NN for Object Recognition
- [ ] Style Transfer NN
- [ ] Finetuning VGGNet Fine Tuning

- [ ] Autoencoder
- [ ] Memory Augmented NN (One-show learning)
- [ ] Attention Module for CNN
- [ ] Sequence to Sequence Model
- [ ] Dynamic Memory Network
